# Blare-Ng
A music streaming app written in a stack a potential employer is needing support for.

**Note**: This is my first Angular app. It probably has stuff thats done wrong, but I will update/fix thing as I figure things out.

## Stack
- C# dotnet Api REST Server
    - MongoDb database
- Angular frontend
    - SCSS styling
    - ``PrimeNG components?`` 
        - I decided to roll my own CSS/SCSS.
- I created a console application `./src/tagScraper` that populates the databas with tags, it will do more soon.

### To Do
- Integrate GCP (Google Cloud Platform)
- Storybook
- Nx
- nrhwl
- Docker
- Azure Devops
- Cypress
